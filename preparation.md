# Preparation

### *If you are following this workshop outside of the live webinar and do not have a Segment workspace feel free to create it [here](https://segment.com/signup)!*


## Part 1 - Set up Your Segment Workspace

*If you have already created a workspace please bear with us until Part 2.*

Please visit https://segment.com/signup and follow the instructions in order to create a new workspace. 


## Part 2 - Create Segment Source
Segment Sources allow you to collect semantic events as your users interact with your web sites, mobile applications, or server-side applications. For this workshop, you will set up an HTTP source!  
Your initial Segment workspace will look like this:

You will need to add an HTTP source, using the ‘Add Source’ button in the screen shot above. To set up a source:

Please enter "workshop_source" as the source name. It'll be used as part of the request URLs we will be making in exercise 2.

Once your source is configured, it will appear in your workspace like this:
